  ```

  [+] -  termux-setup-storage   

  [+] -  pkg install git python python2 -y
  
  [+] -  pip install requests 
  
  [+] -  git clone https://github.com/techiesneh/Sneh-TataSky.git

  [+] -  cp -r Sneh-TataSky storage/dcim

  [+] -  cd storage/dcim/Sneh-TataSky
  
  [+] -  cd code_samples python main.py
  
  [+] -  python main.py

  ```
  
# After Running "python main.py" command in Termux 
  
• Click 1 : Put Your Mobile No. , Subscriber ID or Password for first time . <br>
• Click 2 : Put Your Mobile No. , Subscriber ID or OTP for first time . <br>
• Click 3 : Generate PlayLists Every 24hrs .  <br><br>

• You Get Your PlayLists under "DCIM/Sneh-TataSky/code_samples" Folder of Internal Storage . <br>
• Just Import m3u PlayLists in Tivimate or IPTV Smarter Pro & Enjoy . <br>
• Click On Channel and Play <br>


# Playing in Android TV

+ You can use Kodi with the PVR Simple IPTV Plugin [doesn't work yet]. The generated m3u file already is in the standard format that can be read by the plugin (WIP)
+ You can use Tivimate app to play the m3u playlist too

# Playing in Android 
+ You can use Kodi to play the m3u file(WIP)
+ You can play individual channel using [Exostreamer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mtdeer.exostreamr) 
See the below section on `Getting hold of individual channels` to know how to get the link to play a specific channel as you cannot play the entire playlist
+ Paste the channel url first and then click on the DRM button to enter the license url and then click on play

# Playing in a browser (tried with Chrome)

+ I personally use [Native MPEG-Dash + HLS Playback](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/native-mpeg-dash-%20-hls-pl/cjfbmleiaobegagekpmlhmaadepdeedn) which doesn't suppport playlists yet

See the below section on `Getting hold of individual channels` to know how to get the link to play a specific channel as you cannot play the entire playlist
+  Get the channel url (ends with ```.mpd```) and paste it in the browser
+ The extension automatically asks for the license url. You should then input the  license url.
